# Restaurant Table Reservation


The "Restaurant Table Reservation" project is a system designed to allow customers to book tables at a restaurant in advance. The system can handle the process of 
reserving a table, including the selection of a date, time, number of guests, and table preferences. The goal of the project is to improve the customer experience by 
providing a convenient and efficient way to secure a table reservation, as well as to assist the restaurant in managing reservations and optimizing seating 
arrangements.
